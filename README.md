## **CS 3700**

This course covered the fundamentals of networking and distributed computing. Content included packet-switched networks, transport-layer protocols, socket programming, and HTTP communication. The projects in this repository involve hands-on implementation of client-server architectures utilizing a virtualized networking environment.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various Java-based networking projects completed for CS3700, focusing on practical applications of client-server communication and protocol implementation. Below is an overview of the implemented projects:

- **UDP Client-Server Communication (server_HW2.java, client_HW2.java):**  
Implemented a UDP-based client-server system where the client sends item ID requests, and the server responds with product details. The project explores packet-switched networking, request-response communication, and real-time round-trip time (RTT) measurement.

- **Multithreaded HTTP Server & Client (server_HW3.java, client_HW3.java):**  
Developed a multithreaded HTTP server that handles GET requests, serving files over TCP. The client sends HTTP requests, processes responses, and saves retrieved files locally. The project demonstrates socket programming, HTTP request formatting, and response handling.
